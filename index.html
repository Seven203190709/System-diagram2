<h2>WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<h6>My name is Wang Jiaxiao, my English name is Seven.</h6>
<h3>Hobby</h3>
<h6>I like sports, especially basketball. My favorite basketball star is Stephen Curry, not only because of his basketball skills, but also because of his character, loyal to love and loyal to his family. Confident and assertive on the court, modest off the court.</h6>
<h6>I am also a logical person and like to watch some suspense dramas. I like listening to music, music can immerse me in my own world.</h6>

<h3>Advantages and disadvantages</h3>
<h6>I am a relatively independent person with my own opinions. Can bear hardships and stand hard work. But sometimes I'm lazy and don't have a high interest in some things. However, when it comes to things that have to be done or are more formal and need to be treated with the mentality of an adult, I can still restrain my heart and do it well.</h6>
